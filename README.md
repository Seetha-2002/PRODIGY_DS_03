<br>
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Introduction
This project focuses on building a robust decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we aim to develop a model that accurately forecasts customer purchasing decisions. By harnessing the power of data analytics, this initiative seeks to provide actionable insights that can enhance marketing strategies and drive successful business outcomes. Join me in exploring how data-driven techniques can transform customer engagement and optimize marketing efforts.

## Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that assist banking institutions in identifying clients likely to subscribe to term deposits. By accurately pinpointing potential subscribers, the institution can refine its marketing strategies, enhance campaign efficiency, and optimize resource allocation, ultimately leading to improved outcomes.
## Dataset
The <a href="https://github.com/Seetha-2002/PRODIGY_DS_03/blob/main/bank_data.csv">`dataset`</a> pertains to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. It encompasses a range of features including client demographics, past marketing interactions, and the campaign outcome (subscription to a term deposit).

## Results
The project resulted in the development of decision tree classifiers using both the Gini impurity and entropy criteria. These models exhibited strong accuracy in predicting term deposit subscriptions. The classifier based on the Gini impurity criterion showed a slight advantage over the entropy-based classifier in terms of testing accuracy and recall for the positive class.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting term deposit subscriptions during direct marketing campaigns. By leveraging predictive analytics, the banking institution can refine its marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.
